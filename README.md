# Partial cubes
This repository includes some simple functions to work with partial cubes that I implemented as a PhD student. It also incudes a collection of all partial cubes up to certain dimension.

The code is not documented since it was inteneded only for private use; hopefully I will do this in the future. Nevertheless, one can chech `get_stat.sage` for an example of usage.
